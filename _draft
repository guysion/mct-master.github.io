#  C. whatever comes along the way

Listen here to a short excerpt of our noise jam today, 
EVERYBODY present in the (extended virtual) room was contributing. 


## Diverse mobile phone selection, cheap ear plugs, 9Volt batteries, a lot of coffee, 
7 rules of hacking, chocolate cream and much more: MCT students are getting ready for the mini-hackathon.


*To wrap it up, the first workshop day on 'physical computing' surprised us in many ways.
Exposed to new tools in webtechnology and 'hack' things, we were able to create a little jamsession.  
Some of the tools were familiar, some of them less. To start with the hardest 
challenge, around 2 or 3 out of 14 students had hands-on experiences in programming from before. 
Before we got introduced by code templates to set up a sampler, 
there were moments of frustration and irritation. This is probably unavoidable when learning new skills. 
Fortunately, we were able to establish a collaborative approach to learning 
that everyone could keep up with, regardless of background.*

## Hacking, sound walks?

The sound walk methodology is a way to use man made objects like urban sound and 
reuse it in a different context. For the music context the hacking 
practice could be described as a tool to intrude the ways to use sound-related 
technology to create new, unexpected knowledge and sound.

### Oslo - Rearrange in the membrane

Final week before christmas. After months of experimentation with microphones, lectures with _TICO_, workshops with _Zoom_, jams with _LOLA_ and routing on the _Midas_ mixer - the portal is in disarray.

The main aim in Oslo was to move the _LOLA_ and _TICO_ set up to the other end of the room, so that all connections were more conveniently in the same place. The second task was to change the routing so that all connections, both inputs and outputs passed through the Midas mixer. This was the way it is set up in Trondheim - and makes a lot of sense. Then using the mixer we can group each connection, use effects and adjust levels all in the same place. One control to rule them all!

Monday we got together, with many of the _MCT team_, and moved the whole setup. I present to you the new, improved portal room….

#### And then came Thursday…

With _TICO_-problems in Trondheim and a guest-lecturer in Oslo, in need to be heard at both campuses and also sharing screen with playback audio, things got complicated; the “ant-hill” allegory is again useful, but this time with all the ants (the entire class) pulling in different directions. People started to disconnect, reconnect, trying new connections… then disconnect and reconnect… pulling everything apart and then starting from the top… or from the bottom. And suddenly nobody knew what’s connected to what - and we’re sort of back to the start. New day, new set-up tomorrow :)

So, to get things to work on Friday, it was back to basic… _Zoom_ with sound directly through the loudspeakers.


### Trondheim

The portal was just recently moved to our new location; one floor down, a floor we share together with doctors’ offices, a music school, an instrument maker and music studios. We are hidden behind thick white walls, and doors with locks, keeping our experiments to ourselves and not letting sound out or in. This may sound a bit creepy, but really, it is such a great improvement compared to our previous location. Our new portal room is open and bright, ready for being attacked with our exploration of setups with placements of tables, microphones, projectors, tv’s and other technology.

#### Our new portal setup

After a week with Øyvind Brandtsegg, exploring _Digital Signal Processing_ (DSP), our portal was set up to work as a performance environment between Trondheim and Oslo. We were using _LOLA_ for transmitting the sound of our instruments and _Zoom_ for speech communication. Cables were going all over the place, and _TICO_ was not yet connected in our new portal space.

On monday we rearranged the tables and placed two condenser microphones in front of the tables, as you can see in the picture below. This is how Oslo sees Trondheim, being captured by a _Huddlecam PTZ camera_ over _TICO_. Yes, we connected _TICO_, and it looks really good!

Connecting _TICO_ could not be done before sorting out the mess of cables going all over the place, and removing unused equipment standing in the way. After cleanup, we connected _TICO_ and it was looking great!

Then thursday came and _TICO_ was dropping out like crazy on the Trondheim side during machine learning class, both audio and video. It was left in a mess. Friday, After some hours of connecting stuff and adjusting some settings on the _TICO_ hardware, it was up and running without any dropouts. The improvement felt a bit random, as if it fixed itself, so we decided to leave it on over the weekend to see if it kept being stable.

Sunday the 25. November, Sepehr, Jørgen and Eigil came to the portal to prepare for a _WoNoMute_ talk that was going to be held the day after. _TICO_ had been up and running all weekend and...now it was back to dropouts. The dropouts were present every 10 seconds, and we figured that _TICO_ could not be trusted to be used for the _WoNoMute_ talk. We chose to disconnect it and leave it for now.

Since the problems with _TICO_ are mainly present in Trondheim and not in Oslo, we think the issue is with the network traffic, or with the device itself. Maybe somewhere on the line there is a network hiccup, making the connection go out of sync, resulting in the dropouts in audio and video. I know it has been recorded latency on the line earlier when running the diagnostic tool Traceroute to the IP of the _TICO_ in Oslo. This needs to be investigated further together with Robin and the IT department. That is of course an issue to be fixed.

_Till next time, Team A_

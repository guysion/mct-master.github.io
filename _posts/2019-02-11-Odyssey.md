excerpt: "Odyssey is a Web Audio Api envisioned to immerse users into a misty jungle with sounds of music and nauture. Besides the jungle environemt, the application adds bits of fun providing sounds of domestic animals like dog, cat and a chicken. It may not give you a profound immersion into the environment at the moment though. But I am hopeful that user will enjoy and have fun playing with  it. The application is written in HTML5 and javascript. The sounds are taken from freesound.org while the beautiful picture of the mistyjungle has been borrowed from www.selfgrowth.info/WDF-13569.html."

## Introduction
Odyssey is a Web Audio Api envisioned to immerse users into a misty jungle with sounds of music and nauture. Besides the 
jungle environemt, the application adds bits of fun providing sounds of domestic animals like dog, cat and a chicken. It may not
give you a profound immersion into the environment at the moment though. But I am hopeful that user will enjoy and have fun playing with 
it. The application is written in HTML5 and javascript. The sounds are taken from <a href="http://freesound.org" target="_blank">here</a> while the beautiful picture of the misty jungle has been borrowed from <a href="http://selfgrowth.info/WDF-13569.html" target="_blank">here</a>

The start button plays a jungle environt sound and fills in a jazz piece after around 10 seconds. Four buttons are provided which plays 
sounds of the animal followed by their name. Finally, the stop button ends the application.

## Routing of Different Audio Nodes

 The application is built upon example 3 of both the the first and the third day of the Audio Programming workshop called 'play sound'
 and 'delay node' respectively. The environment sound and jazz music piece have been directly sent to the output without delay or any
 kind of envelope. All other sounds have been individually routed following the figure above.

### Future Plans
I wish to make the application a bit more immersive with binaural/ambisonic techniques and adding varieties of soundscape. Besides, to
make it more interactive, features like mouse interaction can be applied that we exercised during Day 1 of the Audio Programming Workshop in example 6 called 'Mouse Interaction'.

### Learning from the individual mini-project
It was the first time I was learning to code in HTML and javascript thus their was a lot of frustration in the first two days of the workshop. However, the overall environment of working everyone together and later in split groups made it comforting and possible to ask for help in no time. I can now code and create a similar type of web audio api and hope to incorporate some css soon!

#### Acknowledgement
My heartfelt gratitude to Anna xambo for teaching how to create a Web Audio API. Prior to the first week of workshop in the Web Audio API, I had zero knowlede in javascript. Now I can do some coding. Thank you for the lessons, your guidance and patience. I would also like to thank my peers, JÃ¸rgen, Mari and Guy for helping me out with programming, giving suggesitions and sharing their codes. Thank you.

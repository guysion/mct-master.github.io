## ART IS ANYTHING YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH

### Introduction
After having started the day with each group presenting their blog posts, we moved to work on the concept for our prototype instrument. After some discussion we landed on a strategy for making an instrument that could be played via Internet, by using a cell phone as microphone/gadget/”sound collector” in one end - transmitting the signal to a computer and there processed live in a DAW (for our prototype we used Ableton LIVE) - and out on loudspeakers, in the other end - then, sending this signal back again, to the performer (in this case using LOLA), knowing we were diving, head first, into some severe feedback issues. When presenting the idea, this was one of the things we were confronted with: Solution? Experimental music needs, well… experiments! We then took lunch. Bad idea! 

### Coming to a solution
Since our solution was in need of some serious testing, we realized we would run out of time when it, due to some technical issues, turned out that we were not able to get the signal into Ableton on Sam’s computer. So, we started to work the other way around, trying to get the signal through from Sam’s Samsung, using Google Hangouts - and into Ableton on Jørgen’s computer in Trondheim. 

However, with Sam’s phone having only 10% battery left and no available power supply, Oslo started working on backup solutions. This was either sending from a laptop or using Espen’s iPhone. The latter did not work out: Google hangouts installed alright on the iPhone. After some minor problems everything seemed to work OK, but for some strange reason, although we clearly could see the call being sent from the iPhone, it didn’t reach through to Jørgen. In Trondheim Sepehr worked on setting up the analog Korg modules, as another expansion to the instrument, by receiving the signal from the manipulated sound, coming from the Oslo and being processed with spring delay and a frequency shifter on Jørgen’s laptop. These effects were controlled with a phone, using its motion sensors routed over the UDP connection to a Max for Live device in Ableton.

### The performance
As the clock was ticking towards performance things got a little heated, as everyone got a little stressed. With 5 minutes left we wrapped up, everybody barking at each other, and once more told our self that this is an experimental concept. Or rather - a stunt experiment. If everything failed, we could always refer to Murphy’s law. So, after some nail biting 15 minutes, it was our turn: Some fiddling with microphones, loudspeakers, connection, checking battery capacity on the phone, putting together the Little Bits from Korg in Oslo and rechecking the Korg chain in Trondheim, testing sound, biting some more nails, and silently repeating Murphy’s law, we were ready for the event: It started fine. Then, after a minute or something, Oslo realized we could not hear Trondheim. Everything stopped. Then, as if in some kind of anthill, everyone in the room started to check things out. One minute and 30 seconds later it worked, and - EUREKA!

We had a working gig in a feedback-looped setting that actually worked. Sam as a Virtouse on the Korg, Espen moving the cell phone around, thereby adjusting the level of feedback and additionally playing some percussion on the laptop, generated from the visual studio code - and with Trondheim in total control of the processing of the sound with phone sensors and littleBits, - we believe we managed to make an interesting feedback-based event. And - after the performance we got? What else - good feedback. Thanks!

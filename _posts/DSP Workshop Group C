# DSP Workshop – Group C

During our DSP workshop we were introduced to several tools and techniques for creating, manipulating and controlling sound. We started exploring Csound and waveguides. We learned a bit about the code in Csound, setting inputs and outputs and rendering the result to audio files.
We started working on a string sound and were able to apply effects like saturation and reverb. Using the Csound score and p-fields we experimented with writing a composition using frequencies and Midi notes. We learned how to layer and combine several waveguide instruments and created a short composition. Later in the week we got familiar with building VST instruments and effects by using Cabbage, and were able to compile our creations into an application that can be used in any DAW. By using several external input sources like the contact mic or a midi controller we were ready to embark on our main task for the week, creating a short performance using our new instruments, to be performed in the portal simultaneously between Oslo and Trondheim. Each location worked and developed a different kind of instrument.



The instrument in Trondheim makes use of waveguides simulating the sound of a string using the input signal from the contact microphones as a source signal for the attack. The signal path within the instrument can be described as follows:


Sound source
    -Contact microphones on pieces of cardboard going into an external sound card.
    
CSound code
    -Pitch modulation (MIDI key mapping to adjust the pitch of the string waveguide by setting the corresponding delay time frequency as well as vibrato control.)Lowpass filter (helps taming the sound dynamically and also has an interesting side effect of pitching down the sound slightly when hard filtering due to the increase in delay time in the feedback loop).
    -Saturation (Can be used as a tool to make the sound more aggressive while still being pleasant due to the soft clipping. A mix control that fades between wet and dry signal is used to maintain the same level of output at all times.)
    -Reverb (effective way to shape the size of the sound. The same type of effect level control as in the saturation is used here as well.)
Cabbage
    -A middleware between CSound and DAWs used to create VST plugins.
    -Even though one of its features is to design a GUI, I chose to keep it minimalistic with black and white interface with a debugging screen in order to have total control of what’s going on. Cabbage can be a bit unstable, so this feature helped a lot during troubleshooting.
DAW
    -Reaper was chosen for this purpose at it is very cooperative with the Cabbage plugins as well as being the digital audio workstation of choice for one of the group members.
    -Here the contact microphone signals runs to their own dedicated tracks before routing them further to two tracks with separate MIDI controller inputs.
    -The result of the processing within the plugins as well as the Hadron particle synthesizer was then sent back out of the external soundcard in stereo to the mixer to Oslo for them to hear and process it further.

## Personal impressions regarding the performance

Eirik (Trondheim): The performance of the piece was an interesting occasion. We had done some trials before the concert and what had emerged was the dichotomous nature of our setup. When using contact mics in the way we were, one gets a percussive input. Sustained notes are harder to produce than purely percussive, but can be produced by scratching or stroking the cardboard. On the other side, the MIDI controller we used has no real percussive function, but only serves to control the parameters of the contact mics signal. This leaves something to be desired when initially playing the MIDI keyboard. Nevertheless, this gets solved when one changes the way one thinks about playing the keyboard. Rather than looking at i as a trigger, it is helpful to look at it as a preset to the contact mic. First you define the chord by the MIDI controller, before rhythmically defining it through the contact mic.

Quote: _“I function as a channel through which music emerges from the chaos of noise.”_ 


Evángelos Odysséas Papathanassíou, better known as Vangelis, is a Greek composer known especially for his electronic and orchestral film scores. Vangelis was born near Volos, Greece, in 1943. He was mostly self-taught as a musician, starting to practise music at an early age.
Most notable as a film composer, he has made the scores for movies such as Chariots of Fire (1981) and Blade Runner (1982), and music from his scores has also been used outside of films. A pioneer in the use of synthesizers and characteristic style, he is considered one of the most influential composers of electronic music in history, and the impact of his works can be hard to miss in a wide array of musical genres today.

_“I’d say that what we hear is the quality of our listening.”_

Robert Fripp (May 16th 1946) is a British musician born in Dorset, England. After receiving a “very cheap guitar” at age 11 he decided that the guitar would be his life. From early on he was influenced by jazz. His complete discography lists more than 700 releases, but he is most known as the guitarist in King Crimson.

He has used and developed several technological innovations in his music. These include Frippertronics, soundscapes and a new tuning system for guitar (new standard tuning), based on the circle of fifths. Frippertronics is an analogue delay system consisting of two side-by-side reel-to-reel tape recorders. The effect is now found in many commercial loop stations, such as the Boss RC-3.

My hero in music technology is the English sound artist Keith Rowe, born in 10th of March 1940, in Plymouth, England. 

He started with jazz in 1960s and after a while, became interested in experimenting more and turned into free improvisation. That began from laying the guitar flat and playing it with various innovative techniques, and led to involving radio signals in that style of playing, and the creation of sonically new atmospheres. He used to pick up the radio signals with guitar pick-ups and broadcast them through an amplifier. 

He was the pioneer of Electro Acoustic Improvisation (EAI) and many artists in relevant fields, including me, are influenced by him. Regarding that matter, he used to tell his students: _“You are still young. There will come a day that you’ll learn how improvise.”_

Laurie Spiegel, born September 20, 1945, in Chicago Illinois, US.

_“I think of something and want to find it. Or make it if I can’t find it  (…). This is why I have worked hard (.) (T)o make it easier for more people to be able to express themselves in music and art by use of new technology.“_

Laurie tinkered from an early age on, she described herself as a 'shy, awkward nerd girl' and taught herself technological skills and playing classic instruments. At the Bell Labs, Laurie composed 'The Expanding Universe' (1973-1980) on a computer-analog hybrid system named 'GROOVE'. After pioneering the NY new music scene in the early 1980s, she withdrew to focus mainly on developing an intelligent composition software called 'Music Mouse'. 

Her visionary music travels in space on NASA'S 'golden record'.

Misha Mansoor (1984-Present) is an American guitarist and a music producer born in Bethesda, Maryland, United States. He is also known as “Bulb” for his solo project where he slowly gained reputation by posting his music on the Internet. And later he became the founder of his band “Periphery”. 

Misha can be recognized as a pioneer of the “Djent” movement in the modern heavy metal industry. His composition approach of using low tuned guitars, groovy polyrhythmic riffs combined with soaring melodies became a new wave. Later he developed his signature guitar models and launched his own overdrive pedal named “Precision Drive”, which are built to serve the genre. He circumvented the traditional industry by the opportunities of the emerging digital paradigm which opened new doors for musicians.

_“As far as the rock 'n' roll format in dance music goes, I don't think it's been done before with such full-on attitude. The idea behind that was because no-one else hade done it. Everything was right at the time for us to do that.”_

Born is Essex, England in 1971, Liam Howlett is the musical force behind the Prodigy, known as "the Godfathers of Rave”, one of the most successful electronic acts of all time. He is the founder, writer, mixer, and producer for the act responsible for bringing rave music and culture to the mainstream, selling a total estimated of 30 million records worldwide.

He is a classically trained pianist and DJ.  During the 1980s he was attracted to the hip hop culture, a style seen in much of his music. After meeting Keith Flint at an outdoor party, the band was formed. Moving from rave to distorted punk rock, back to ambient, Liam retains impact today with music that defines youth, and spans many electronic genres.

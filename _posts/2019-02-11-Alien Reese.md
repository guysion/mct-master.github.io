excerpt: The project I have developed on over the first week of web audio based programing is called Reese da Alien - a web based synth of sorts with mouse functionality. The idea is that the program presents a relatively novel way of producing a reese, by the user moving around the mouse on the the page to find different sweet spots as they affect the pitch and amplitude of two oscillators with the movements. The persona of the application came after early in development I likened the sounds to an alien talking â€“ I felt it a fitting title for the weird, abrasive sounds that the program creates.

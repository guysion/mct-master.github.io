# Recording and sampling

Today we recorded sounds using three techniques; Circuit sniffing, earbuds through mini-amplifier, and with a contact mic.
We then used some of the sounds we recorded in a sampler, made using web technologies, including javascript with the library P5.js.

## 

The table underneath are the sounds used in the sampler in Trondheim. All of the sounds are recorded with the contact mic.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>nr.</th>
    <th>Material</th>
    <th>Behaviour</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>1.</th>
    <td>Keyboard</td> 
    <td>
      Not that much of dynamics in recording because of the sound source - but it picked it up pretty good
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>2.</th>
    <td>Voice</td> 
    <td>
      Talking into a paper tube and an iron box - the amount of reverb in the iron box was more significant
      and the sound effect was more reach in high mid areas
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td>Cymbal</td>
    <td>
      Used overdrive to get the proper level and that ruined the details in the sound.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4.</td>
    <td>Tom</td>
    <td>
      Nice transients and Dynamics.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

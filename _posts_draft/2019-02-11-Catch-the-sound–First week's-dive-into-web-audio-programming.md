Getting familiar with some of the basic JavaScript syntax was the first days work. 
We did small practices and learned about the interplay of different web technologies like 
html, CSS and JavaScript which shed some light. Apart from the nice things one can do with web audio as we 
learned through different online examples the main possibilities for me have been opened by skimming some of the 
papers from the web audio conferences and the mini-presentations of some selected papers introduced by the fellow students. 
It is possible to create simple, but effective applications on the web browser, even without prior knowledge. 
However, it took way longer to implement those ideas, but luckily there is always someone around to ask.

## Mini-Logbook and achievments

It took some time to decide what I want to go for more in depth since there are so many options.
The first day I tried to work with audio spatialization online. The code I found was pretty advanced and 
I didn't wanted to spend to much time understanding it, so I rolled back to something more simple as a start.
Inspired by the tone.js and its <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">examples on audio sound synthesis</a> with sample files I got the idea to create 
something similar. Finally I chose to work with audio samples, uploading them and processing them on the web browser 
like <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/examples/grainPlayer.html">here</a>. I spend a lot of time finding out how to mapp
the input to the output by the syntax. How to know what to do when you don't know what to ask for? Gradually things
became more clear. Signal flow chart helped a lot to visualize what is happening.

Different tasks require different work-flows, to adapt within a different environment turned out to be useful. It was essential 
to start with templates and then move on and research more examples online and then copy paste different parts of the code 
elements. One of the main challenges was to not despair and keep sticking to the matter. The spaghetti code will eventually 
make sense at some point. Of course on the long run skills like creativity and looking for unconventional paths are of use 
since there are different ways to get to the same goal. And that works best with trail and error and letting yourself get inspired and motivated 
by more interesting things than you're working at the beginning.

## Make the argument function

Ever returning questions were, how can I recognize the difference between a function, an argument and other means of code?
When will I finally learn when to use what and why. 
It is recommended to expect to achieve the full spectrum of patience and endurance more than once. 
And it happens to not see the forest for the trees. I had to overcome that idea of doing something complex 
which blocked me at the beginning. In spite of the fact that it can get quite complex at some point, what it basically is as I realized equals more 
building abstract blocks and pieces, elements and trying to keep them together. 
The good thing is with audio programming that you immediately are able to proof what you have been coding 
simply by listening – is there any sound? It keeps you in the flow and motivates to explore further.


## What's next?
I hope to create something collaboratively in the group project and have the possibility to develope the project further.

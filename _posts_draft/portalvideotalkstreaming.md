Eigil's notes:
  How to use OBS with for example Youtube to stream content from the portal to a wide audience
    First a little context on streaming ("you are the content")
      Live streaming can enable fast interaction, two-way-communication.
    What is OBS?
      and a little bit on how to use it
    
    For Sepehr: How we've been setting up streaming together with Oslo for WoNoMute

<!-- The blog post should include at least one photo and an embedded video showcasing the mini-project. It is a plus if you add links to the source code and a live demo link (e,g. directory in a personal webpage). The blog post should also include:
- Description: What is the title of the project and main concept. Overview of the technologies used.
- Timeline: Provide an overview of the 3 days that you have been working in the mini-project. What have you been working on?
- Division of labour: Explain who has been working in what, how you have documented it, working strategies and technologies used.
- Live demo: Try to allocate some time for a live demo.
- Achievements: Give a summary of the achievements of this week through the project. Any progress?
- Challenges: Give a summary of the challenges that you have been encountering over the week and how you did face them?
- What is next? e.g. blog post, code repository, website publishing... more development? -->

## The team

## Timeline

## Ideas and prototypes

#### Reece da Alien

- Originally made for experimenting with phasing and clashing frequencies 

- Uses both  mouse & keyboard

- FM synthesis functionality

- Audio clip sampler

- can be used for creating reese sounds, for sound design or fun!

- whoh! Alien are out there dude .... 


#### Spaghetti Player with Touch Events

- Found a tutorial on how to make touch events work on: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events

- Added canvas with drawing functionality

- Filter controlled by touch movements. 

#### Pointilator synth


Basis and inspiration for using Canvas to draw visual feedback when playing.
Used Canvas as click input.
Played note events based on position of clicks.


#### Hello there human.


#### Prototype: - Reece Da Alien with sonified drawing pad


- Implemented the touch events code into Sam’s Alien Synth

- Two oscillators controlled by X and Y movements in the canvas

- But the buttons and volume slider didn’t work by this point


## Flowchart

## Achievements

- Working prototype
- Implemented the following:
  - Touch interaction
  - Sound
    - Samples
    - Synthesis
    - Effects
  - Styled website
  - Responsive design
- Combined elements by linking scripts
- Implemented lessons from the workshop

## Challenges

## Issues & Further Development 

- Audio gets degraded over time due to inefficient scripts that leak over time

- Is a one trick pony - could have more parameters for a more complete app

- Canvas is centred, but would be preferable for an adjusted aspect ratio that fills the screen on every device

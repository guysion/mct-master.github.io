# SynthWave Pad

## How it started
It was a wonderful journey we had for a week getting hands-on experience with Web audio API and JavaScript. In the beginning, I was tensed about the way that I will handle coding with zero prior experience. But, at the end of the week, I was happy about what I have managed to achieve. I was lacking ideas to start a project for the week but after getting introduced to oscillators, I thought of making a synthesizer or a drum pad that works on the browser. So it was either to work with Oscillators or sound loops.

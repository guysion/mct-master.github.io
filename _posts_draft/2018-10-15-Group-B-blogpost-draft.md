Work on mixer/microphone setup in Oslo
Anything about the Polycom system?

This week was the Lola-week. In Oslo, we got a lot of help from Anders, our guru. He learned us everything we needed to know about Lola. First, we connected Lola with the local network to try out things. We found out that it was time to try out the extended classroom-solution with the BenQ projector and started to move furniture and equipment to the projector wall in the Oslo Portal. Because, you can't use any equipment you want with Lola. Lola is choosy. Lola knows what she wants. There is only one computer that runs Lola, and this computer has to be exclusivly for Lola only. And there is only one camera that works with Lola. And the camera USB cable is short. Sooo short. So if you want to move the camera somewhere, you have to move the whole computer. And that's not just a tiny laptop, that is a 10 kg giga Fractal Design cabinet stuffed with the best you can get regarding computer components. Anders says, by the way, that the computer would be a brilliant computer for gaming. But that is not gonna happen. This computer is for Lola only.

Soo, after moving all equipment to the projector wall, we started trying out different settings with Lola. We started with the lowest solution, choosing black and white over colours. But computer says noooo. Lola #likes# colours. So for some reason, Oslo were streaming in colours, even when choosing b/w. We soon figured out that we couldn't really send much data over the local network before the image got frozen.

Next day, our big mission was to get sound working with Lola. Also, we had to move our equipment in Oslo back to the end corner of the classroom, because we were going to try out the optical fiber network connection (the same that is used with Tico). And the fiber network cable is short, soo short and fragile. 

First thing we discovered was how kick-ass the fiber network really is. Yesterday, we barely were able to stream in black and white with very low resolution and with high amount of compression. Today, with the fiber network connection, we could send gigabytes of data, without any problems. The sound quality was also extremly good.

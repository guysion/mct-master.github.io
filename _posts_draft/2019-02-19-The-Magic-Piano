# The Magic Piano
During our second week learning about Audio programing and web Audio API we were divided into groups and had to come up with an idea for a final project. The main challenges were to find an idea that is doable within 4 days, to code collaboratively and to prepare for the presentation of our project. Guy had an Idea for building a piano keyboard that will help beginners play a simple melody and Ashane and Jørgen agreed to collaborate and join forces in creating ‘The Magic Piano’.

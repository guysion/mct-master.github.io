# The Coolboard

The end of the week had come, and the last day of the workshop was here. The final task was to gather everything we had learned and culminate it into an instrument concept. The day was split in two, with the first part of the day being primarily for conceptualization and the last part of the day, dedicated to building our instrument in the mini-hackathon. Up to now, the week had been a mixture of confusion and pleasure in being able to produce and use the technologies we had been introduced to.

## Forming our ideas

Conceptualizing is not that easy in a educational setting. First of all one has to think about the aesthetic and artistic goals, the wishes of the people in the group all the while thinking of the learning outcomes. The culmination of the workshop needs to show that we had developed skills of computational thinking and programming and had some experience with creating prototypes with low-tech technologies. Initially we thought about sticking to the Korg LittleBits - this would be relatively easy and we could quickly form a working prototype. But after the first break, when we met on Zoom, Elias pitched an idea that was inspired by the temperature of the Oslo Portal room and a glance down on the Arduino sensors we had. Fitting an arduino board with temperatures and light sensors, and routing the data from those into Ableton would allow us to attach different effects to the sensor parameters. For instance, we could fit a reverb filter to the photo-sensor which resulted in the addition of more reverb to the signal whenever there was more light. This we could do with any parameter/effect in Ableton, which produced a powerful instrument. 

One of the ingenious things about this setup is that with a normal sound card with a Â¼ jack, XLR input or MIDI, you could add just about any signal into the chain and control it with the light and temperature sensor. You could use everything from an electric guitar, voice or even the Korg LittleBits as the initial input in our instrument. This makes our instrument, now dubbed the CoolBoard, into a very versatile instrument. It is also interesting to note that the concept revolves around interaction with the environment it is in. It changes according to location, with the light and temperature sensors picking up the environment. The artist/musician can choose to alter these for artistic purposes, with for example blowing hot air on the temperature sensor or covering the photo sensor with her hand.

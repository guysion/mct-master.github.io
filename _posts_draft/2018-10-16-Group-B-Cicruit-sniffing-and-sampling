During todays’ workshop, we hunted for sounds, created by electromagnetic interferences and vibrations using headphones, contact mics, and portable speakers, then hacked a p5js “sampler” to play the found sounds. 

<!-- Maybe a bit more on the sounds and descriptions on the process leading up to the performance? -->

Coding in html went from despair to laughter as we slowly grasped the fundamentals of p5js-based coding, hacked the sampler, and finally performed together, creating a cacophony of noise across campuses of UiO and NTNU.

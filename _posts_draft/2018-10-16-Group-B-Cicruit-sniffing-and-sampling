During todays’ workshop, we hunted for sounds, created by electromagnetic interferences and vibrations using headphones, contact mics, and portable speakers, then hacked a p5js “sampler” to play the found sounds. 

We followed three methods to capture sounds the first experiment was to identify exciting interfering radio signals where the headphone was used as the antenna. 
We managed to capture interferences near copy machines, card reader machines and near mobile phones.

Then we experimented with connecting our headphones to an amp where the headphones act as a microphone. 
The Overdrive was a fascinating knob to experiment and we captured some feedback noises (Those were too loud!!!)






<!-- Maybe a bit more on the sounds and descriptions on the process leading up to the performance? -->

Coding in html went from despair to laughter as we slowly grasped the fundamentals of p5js-based coding, hacked the sampler, and finally performed together, creating a cacophony of noise across campuses of UiO and NTNU.

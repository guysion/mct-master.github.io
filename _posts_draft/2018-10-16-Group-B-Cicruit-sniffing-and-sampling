During todays’ workshop, we hunted for sounds, created by electromagnetic interferences and vibrations using headphones, contact mics, and portable speakers, then hacked a p5js “sampler” to play the found sounds. 

We tried out three methods to capture sounds. The first experiment was to identify exciting interfering radio signals where the headphones were used as the antenna. 
We managed to capture interferences near copy machine, card reader machine and near mobile phones.

Then we experimented with connecting our headphones to an mini marshall amp . 
The Overdrive was a fascinating knob to experiment and we captured some feedback noises (Those were too loud!!!)

Thirdly we experimented with a connecting a contact microphone directly to the miarshall amp.  






<!-- Maybe a bit more on the sounds and descriptions on the process leading up to the performance? -->

Coding in html went from despair to laughter as we slowly grasped the fundamentals of p5js-based coding, hacked the sampler, and finally performed together, creating a cacophony of noise across campuses of UiO and NTNU.

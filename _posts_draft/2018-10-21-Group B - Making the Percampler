The Final day of the physical computing was based on creating a custom made instrument based on the knowledge and experience gained from 
the past three days. It was a challenge to us to work on an instrument that can be performed across the two universities. In the morning 
we brainstormed different ideas about what exactly we are going to build in the limited amount of time given (Only Three Hours!!!).Then we 
decided on this cool concept of combining the digital and analog worlds that we explored during the past workshops.So we called it an 
analog digital hybrid percussive synthesizer aka **“Percampler”**. 

Eigil and Shreejay suggested the idea on using a contact microphone as an input for the little bits and producing beats and percussive 
elements. In Oslo, Dmitry, Mari and Ashane experimented on assigning multiple inputs from a smartphone, laptop and midi keyboard to a 
chain of little bits where it can generate percussive synthesizer sounds that corresponds to whatever the input.

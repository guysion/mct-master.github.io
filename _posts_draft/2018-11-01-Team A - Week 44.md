### Cleaning up
It is very important and professional to keep the signal chain (physically) clear and cabling clean and tidy.
We thus decided to tidy up the portal, making it easier for everybody to see the signalchain and able to troubleshoot. Epecially in the way that MCT students are supposed to work together (in 3 teams, in charge of modification and doing the portal job, in order, every week). This will also help a lot if we are to modify or move the components in the future; otherwise it would be very hard to follow what is what.

During the clean up process there were some unused equipment and cables found laying around in the portal. You can view the amount of equipment in the picture below. Needless to say, how space consuming and confusing their presence could be. Although one of these was an RME device, which is supposed to be used for multichannel communication, we chose to remove it since we did not have the cable needed for implementing it.

### Working on improving the communication via TICO

When speaking at a distance of approx. 60cm or less from the microphones, we could both in Oslo and Trondheim experience our voice as more reverberant. This was due to feedback, where our voice was sent through TICO, and then "leaked" into the microphones at the recieving end. The reverberant issue was much more present for us in Trondheim, implying that the speaker and microphone setup in Oslo had to be improved, reducing the feedback. To fix the problem in Oslo, we managed to add a third cardioid condenser microphone (DPA2011) in order to cover all the people in the room, with less gain on the microphones. In additon we turned down the output level in Trondheim slightly, adjusted the microphone angles to reject most of the sound coming from the speakers, and lowered the gain of the microphones closest to the speakers. Together the reverberant effect went away at normal speaking distances, which is when you are seated in your chair, and not leaning too close to the microphone. The critical distance to the microphone will of course depend on the speakers/persons voice level, which we have found can vary a bit in our class. It would be nice to try to compansate for both low and high level voices in our system in a good way, where increasing feedback is accounted for.

### Modifying the signal chain in Oslo

The big problem is the variation of the ways being used in order to control the I/O. Therefore having a proper signal chain map could help the groups to work together, in a proper order, and modify things.

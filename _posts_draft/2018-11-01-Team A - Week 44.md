## A-team, Cleaning up / Working on improving the communication via Tico

### Cleaning up:
It is very much important and professional to keep the signal chain (physically) clear and cabling clean and tidy.
That will help a lot to modify the setting in the future; otherwise it would be very hard to follow what is what.
Specially in the way that MCT students are supposed to work together (in 3 teams, in charge of modification and doing the portal job, in order, every week).

Also during the clean up process there were some unnecessary equipments and cables found in the portal, that were not being used.
You can mention the amount of the unused equipments in portal room, in the picture below. Needless to say, how space consuming and confusing, their presence could be. Although one of the equipments, was an RME device, which is supposed to be used for multi channel communication; but since we do not have the needed cable for it, it is going to be out of portal room for now as well.

### Working on improving the communication via Tico:

In order to have less feedback which was an issue, more in Trondheim thatn Oslo. That meant the way that mics and speakers were set up in Oslo was much more problematic. To fix the problem in Oslo, we managed to add a third cardioid condenser microphone (DPA2011) in order to cover all the people in the room, with less gain on the microphones.

That happen to fix the feedback issue in Trondheim to some extents. Also for Trondheim, we had to lower the gain of the mics closer to the people sitting in the room and also the ones closer to the speakers. That helped to even fix more of the feedback issue, both in Trondheim and Oslo.

### A-team, Cleaning up / Working on improving the communication via Tico

#### Cleaning up:
It is very much important and professional to keep the signal chain (physically) clear and cabling clean and tidy.
That will help a lot to modify the setting in the future; otherwise it would be very hard to follow what is what.
Specially in the way that MCT students are supposed to work together (in 3 teams, in charge of modification and doing the portal job, in order, every week).

Also during the clean up process there were some unnecessary equipments and cables found in the portal, that were not being used.
You can mention in the picture below, the amount of the unused equipments in portal toom. Needless to say, how space consuming and confusing, their presence could be.

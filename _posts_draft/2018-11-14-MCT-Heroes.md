“You can't always write a chord ugly enough to say what you want to say, so sometimes you have to rely on a giraffe filled with whipped cream.” - Frank Zappa 

Frank Zappa was an American composer, musician and producer born in 1940 in Maryland, United States. From early on, he showed interest in modern composers such as Stravinsky and Varèse, and his music reflects an interest in dissonant music and irregular rhythms. He is known for a great number of record releases and his humorous and satirical song lyrics. Zappa started his musical career as a drummer, but during most of his career, he fronted his bands as a guitarist and a vocalist. Zappa died from prostate cancer in 1993, and is today considered a rock legend world over.

If you enter Metamorph, an art and technology space in the old town of Trondheim (Bakklandet), you will immediately become part of the 
the generative soundscape of the exhibition 'Metaverk'.  
The sound installation is a joint work by Ã˜yvind Brandtsegg and Arnfinn Killingtveit and invites you to discover, 
interact with it by making live music or connecting your phone to a mini jack cable and influence the sound environment. 
The exhibition is part of the Trondheim Open, the largest art biennial in Central Norway. 
Its aim is to make more local artists visible on the plan.

## Memories that sound

Within the framework of the open source concept, visitors were invited to explore the composition of the exhibition. 
Even the pure data (?) code, for example, which programs the various units is visible on screens. The hardware, consisting of 
several flashing monitors (more of sculputural character), microphones, cables and loudspeakers are grouped into different units. 
These computer entities have their own processing character and communicate only via audio. 
Some wait for silence, others react to a knock at the window: it is a string model that is based on a delay loop input
based on the contact microphones. Each sound event is recorded and displayed in a feedback system. 
Even speech becomes audible with some delay, like memories in distorted and faded manners.
Finally, being physically present in this situation means being part of the machine and at the same time 
one remembers one's sense of human and vulnerability.

## How to

And how does that all relate to what we do now?
The underlying techniques are based on the same principles, which are only applied in different ways and are very much 
related to what we will be dealing with in the upcoming DSP workshop. Most of the component and sound units are based on waveguides. 
Very briefly, a waveguide is a delay line that represents how the sound moves through a string. 
A longer delay line is the same as a longer string and results in a lower pitch, the reason why you make it sound 
like a string is because you have very high feedback, like 98% feedback. It is very fragile because if you turn down the
feedback, you only get one click and if you turn it on, it will explode at about 100%.
These are techniques that we will be working with and experimenting with to connect different strings through the portal.

The bone feedback station, as shown below, also uses a waveguide technique to improve the possibility of feedback from the bone.

# Trials and Tribulations
## A-team, Opening week of MCT

The first week at The Portal was interesting. Most of the equipment was not ready for use, and the TICO system network card crashed two days before opening ceremony. 

Our group, Jørgen, Espen, Sam and Juno, started working on Monday 27. August, and tried to set up the Polycom system as a backup for the week in the Portal. 

Polycom is a [video conference system]()

## A-team, Week 36
### Setting up the remporary portal #

In order to set up the sound system in the temporary portal room, we (Jørgen and Sepehr) used 4 microphones (Cardioid polar pattern) to capture the sound of the people, back in Trondheim; each capturing approximately 2 people, sitting on a table (we had 4 tables in the room). The signal went to the Mixer we had up and running via 4 separate channels. After that the signal traveled from 2 outputs (left and right) of the mixer to the left and right input of the sound card, of the main computer in the temporary portal room.

Also the sound received from Oslo portal room was sent to the speaker via output 1 and 2 of the main computer's sound card.
No need to mention that the program used for the communication was Zoom which Inside its setting one can assign the inputs and outputs for the communication.

One of the important issues that we ran into was that the level of people talking around the room, which was being automated by default, by the Zoom. So basically it was being changed constantly to equalize the different sound sources (people talking around the room) on the same level; which unfortunately ruined the gain settings that we had adjusted for the microphones (In order to capture everyone in the room loud and clear). So this is very important to turn it off (by making sure that the "Automatically adjust the microphone" tick is off), whenever you log in to that program, in order to be able to adjust the proper level manually.

Also another usefull tip is to test the levels via the "test mic" and "test speaker" options, so you could make sure that input and output levels (on both sides) are not too much loud or weak.
For instance, of course if you were hearing clipping, then you have to check your own output level by the "test speaker" option on your side, and then the other side's input level; and vice versa.

Regarding the video we managed to higher up the height of the camera, therefore we could have a more wide picture and avoid people, being blocked by objects, such as speakers.

### Audiovisual communication through the portal

#### Challenges and solutions:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Challenge</th> 
    <th>Solution</th>
    <th>Reflections</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>1.</th>
    <td>Fit 7 students and a teacher into the picture</td> 
    <td>Raised the camera (bird view) and placed 4 tables in a half circle</td>
    <td>
      Everybody is seen, and gets equal priority. The teacher does not have a dedicated place,
      but until now the teachers has naturaly placed themselves by the computer, so they can
      have control over Zoom and their presentation. We think this solution made it more comfortable
      for the students placed nearest to the big screen, since they don't have to turn their neck as
      much while looking at "Oslo".

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>2.</th>
    <td>Everyone must be heard from their position</td> 
    <td>We placed one condencer microphone per table, and put them in cardoid characteristic.</td>
    <td>
      The microphones are capturing everyone, and feedback is being avoided with the placements and
      microphone patterns. The microphones may be hindering a "natural" way of communicating if you
      feel like you are being recorded all the time, since the microphone is literaly in your face.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3.</td>
    <td>We need to hear Oslo clearly</td>
    <td>Connected the computer and Zoom to the stereo speakers</td>
    <td>
      The speakers are of high quality and represents the audio coming through Zoom well. The problem
      with audio quality now is that the audio resolution through Zoom is low. The speaker setup does
      not represent where in the Oslo-room the sound is coming from, but the sound is atleast coming
      from the same direction as the screens.

### Problems in communications that we need to be aware of and have to work on:

* The fact that we are in two seperate places, looking at each other thorugh screens, talking through
microphones and listening through speakers, makes it more difficult to:
  * Show that you want to say something
  * Be aware that you are interrupting someone
  * See the one who takes the word

**Sometimes I (Jørgen) can feel the need for that walkie-talkie word "over" when someone is finished speaking**,
but i think that would ruin the search for a more natural communication. We need another way to solve this
problem.

Regarding seeing who's speaking we first of all need to make the video window of "Oslo" bigger. In Zoom, when
sharing a screen, the window gets cropped and we haven't yet found a solution for making it bigger. This needs
to be solved.

### The temporary portal-room

the room itself isn't ideal for this kind of portal, and of course we all know that. But, what we can do is **keep
the room as tidy as we can**. The technology isn't yet fully wireless (not even close), so **there are many cables
going all over the place. These should be coiled and/or taped to the ground to avoid tripping on them, hurting
yourself and expensive equipment.**

I have noticed that people tend to move things, like tables and microphone stands, to get around in the room.
This can be totaly necessary, but it happens that the equipment don't get placed back to its position. **We all
need to be aware that equipment, tables, chairs etc. are placed where they are for a reason.**

### Working as a group 501 km apart through the portal

First of all i need to say that this is one really **great group of people to be working with**, and i'm looking
forward to working together on this project :grin:

**No matter how well the group goes along there will be difficulties making the collaboration go smootly**, and I
have som pointers:

* **The technology is not running as well as we want**, so network dropouts, sudden volume reductions and so on
can make people **repeat things over and over**, and this leads to the **work going slower, which again can make
people loose their attention (maybe).**

* **Equipment and expertise from teachers can be available at different times/days in Oslo and Trondheim**. This
can make it more difficult to get both sides to be **available at the same time**. This week it happend to us
(of course we solved it :wink:), but it can cause problems. The Oslo-guys could finish the work on their end on monday,
but Sepehr and I (Jørgen) had to wait until tuesday to really get started on our room because of equipment needs. Since
the Oslo-guys were finished there was no reason for them to come to the school other than just doing a soundcheck on our
microphone setup. Of course it would be nice, but it's no point in a long travel just for that reason. (We dont have to have this example in the blog, but i feel the need to somehow describe the challenge of being at different places and still be cooperating on the kind of same thing (I'm also tired when writing this, so..))

**Last note!** We finally got the last group member, **Sepehr**! :smiley: He is a great guy with lots of knowledge.

# Introduction

We were responsible for the portal during week 39 (Sep 24th-28th).This was the week we decided to explore playing music over the portal between the two campuses (UiO-NTNU).
The need for experimenting with playing music online came from both students and teachers. Many of us were eager to share the things we like to do the most (playing music). Also, there was a need to play music together for demonstration during the music cognition course.
During the first jam on Tuesday the 25th, in Oslo, we used the portal microphones from the room, connected the piano to the mixer in the back of the room and installed two speakers, dedicated for the piano player to hear herself. Demitri was on guitar and Guy on saxophone.
We played ‘Fly me to the moon’, ‘Wonderful Tonight’ and a random blues.

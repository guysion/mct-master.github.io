## First undertitle

From the week before, we had been chasing some issues regarding the teaching situation. 

### Setting up Tico.

The number one priority this week was to get Tico up and running. The previous week, all lectures and communication between
the two campuses had been through Zoom, and quite a lot of time had been consumed by solving technical problems and issues
regarding the Zoom connection. 

As we understand it, the firmware of the Tico box had been updated in Oslo side during the weekend, and this was going to
solve much of the problems we have had before.  So on Monday morning, when suddenly Robin's face covered the whole screen in
Oslo, with crystal clear quality - every little wrinkle and furrow of his hairy face revealed - we in Oslo were all a little
stunned.

And amazed. What a picture quality! So uncompressed! This was of a different world - it was more like going to the iMAX 
movies (the world's dullest Viking movie though), but yeah. It was quite amazing.

Unfortunately, there was still no picture coming through from the Oslo side up to Trondheim. So again - *again* - AGAIN!! - 
we were back in business with Zoom.  However - the sound from Trondheim was working both ways, so we was able to work with
the Tico audio set-up.

The Oslo set-up from the previous week had somehow been rigged down, so we were back to scratch. We had been
discussing setting up a "one-long-table"-solution, with the tables facing the wall, to make it look like we were all 
sitting around one long table in Oslo and Trondheim. At this point, the solution could not be tested out, as the Tico sound
was very sensitive to feedback. We had to place the microphones about two metres from the speakers, and the speakers were 
placed on each side of the 4xmonitor for Tico. Then we solved the Zoom issue by setting up a permanent set-up with Zoom
booting from a Lenovo laptop, using the Panasonic TV as a monitor. We used the Logitech Sausage camera for routing both
the sound and video to Trondheim. 

We decided upon using two condenser microphones in between of two tables, as shown on the picture. Besides from that, the
table set-up for teaching situations was very similar to the set-up from previous week.

<!-- This text is just a comment in the source html.
some notes:
should maybe have a quick rundown on the practical set-up referencing what was done last week as well.
  Illustrations of set-up
How it's supposed to work.
results and issues: important to note the huge improvement in audio quality with tico and that we used it so send our mixes through the portal.
Still needing some work, a bit unstable (hopefully working throughout next week)

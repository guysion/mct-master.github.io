## First undertitle

<!-- This text is just a comment in the source html.
some notes:
should maybe have a quick rundown on the practical set-up referencing what was done last week as well.
  Illustrations of set-up
How it's supposed to work.
results and issues: important to note the huge improvement in audio quality with tico and that we used it so send our mixes through the portal.
Still needing some work, a bit unstable (hopefully working throughout next week)

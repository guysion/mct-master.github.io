# Preparing the portal for Entrepreneurship presentation

Our portal has been suffering from both audial and visual issues since the beginning of the MCT program. 
We solve one problem and the next is just waiting in line to show itself. **NOW**, we all had an exam
just around the corner, an exam where we were going to hold a presentation in the portal across
campuses. **The importance of a working portal now felt very crucial!** With this in mind we started
working on visability, audibility and reliability.

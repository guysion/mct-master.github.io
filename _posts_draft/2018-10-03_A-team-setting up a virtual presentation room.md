# Preparing the portal for Entrepreneurship presentation

Our portal has been suffering from both audial and visual issues since the beginning of the MCT program. 
We solve one problem and the next is just waiting in line to show itself. **NOW**, we all had an exam
just around the corner, an exam where we were going to hold a presentation in the portal across
campuses. **The importance of a working portal now felt very crucial!** With this in mind we started
working on visibility, audibility and reliability.

## Setup in Oslo


### Visibility
We chose to set up the presentation in front of the class, with the slides window at the portable screen and the panel sitting to the presenter's right side. Then, both the presenters and the panel saw both screens. Also, if the presenters wanted to point to a slide, it would look the same on the Trondheim side. 


### Audibility
We put up two condenser microphones, one in front of the presenters and one for the panel.

### Visibility
Since the Tico camera was on the side of the room, the picture that was being sent to Oslo didn’t include all of people present in the class, back in Trondheim. Therefore we managed to find a better angle for the camera to have all the people in the room, in the picture; and that was done via putting the camera on the center speaker in the room and rearranging the speakers in the room.

### Audibility

#### Experiencing sound issues
During our week in the portal we have experienced some problems with audio both in Oslo and Trondheim.
Here is a list of issues:
* Low volume
* Delay, one repeat after you have said something
* Reverb hall effect under the dry sound of the voice
* Reversed sound playing under the dry voice
* Bad volume balance between windows system sounds and recieved sound from Oslo, resulting in extreme loudness
from system sounds if we want to here Oslo.

After hours of troubleshooting we found that the Midas M32 in Oslo was sending sound from TICO. Turning down the
master on this mixer resolved all the weird sound effects that had occured. We think the signal flow in the portal
in Oslo is too little intuitive, and should be changed to a more similar setup to what we have in Trondheim, using
only one mixer.

To solve the low volume and volume balance issues we raised the gain level from Oslo, and adjusted the system sounds
volume in the Windows mixer.

### Reliability - TICO first, Zoom second
Because of TICO's supperior video quality over Zoom, we decided together with Ben Tocher, the teacher in
the entrepreneurship course, to make it our primary video source. **BUT**, since the TICO system is very
unreliable we had to have a backup system, which was Zoom. In case TICO would go crazy - turning off
for a long period of time or displaying all the colors of the rainbow, it had to be a quick way of 
changing video source to Zoom.

In short, the setup ended up being:

* Panasonic (large screen) as computer _primary screen_, **used for control over pc and presentation material**
* Sony (smaller screen) as computer _extended screen_, **used for displaying video from either TICO or Zoom, depending on input source**
* Audio running through Zoom

The 4 day DSP workshop introduced basics of Digital Signal Processing techniques. We were given few examples in Csound that generated different kinds of sounds. The exercises allowed us to take the ownership of the codes while modifying and creating new sounds. We used simple operations like addition and multiplication to process the digital signals.  We enjoyed experimenting with digital waveguides to model sounds travelling through strings and also manipulating with reverbs delay, envelope etc. Trondheim team also built an instrument with a piece of wood connected to a contact mic and used it in some of the tasks.


Notes:

Quick rundown of the buildup during the workshop
  working mostly in paithatrs
  incremently building our instrument
Performance
  testing our signal chain with lola
  diagram of signal path
  instrument design and DSP methods
    screenshots/photos could be uploaded
  Each role in the performance
  results 
    improvisation
    recording (can be taken from LoLa computer in Trondheim)

## Abstract

The 4 day DSP workshop introduced basics of Digital Signal Processing techniques. We were given few examples in Csound that generated different kinds of sounds. The exercises allowed us to take the ownership of the codes while modifying and creating new sounds. We used simple operations like addition and multiplication to process the digital signals.  We enjoyed experimenting with digital waveguides to model sounds travelling through strings and also manipulating with reverbs delay, envelope etc. Trondheim team also built an instrument with a piece of wood connected to a contact mic and used it in some of the tasks.

## C stands for Crazy

Until now, the DSP workshop week must have been one of the funniest weeks of the MCT Introduction course, and one of the weeks with the steepest learning curve for several of us. The week started with a Csound test that was unbelievably difficult for some of us, and more easy for others of us. Those of us who thought the test was difficult, were maybe a little worried about what this week would be bringing up of challenges. At least *one* of us, was worried if this week was going to include a lot of math. As it seemed like Csound mostly was a program for solving math problems, not making music  …. or?

## Go ahead and make something!

Fortunately for this one group member, we didn’t need to solve a lot of math problems during this week. No, this was so much more fun than math! From day one, we were able to try out things on our own in Csound. I think for most of the people located in Oslo, we were stuck with some confusion when after only a short introduction to Csound, the teachers just said: “Now, go ahead and make something!”. For those of us who had never been into Csound before, who had barely been doing any code before, this was scary. And a little annoying. What were we supposed to make? And how? 

Ashane and Mari found a group room, and pretty soon our annoyance was turned into joy and amusement. By slightly manipulating the example codes, we were able to make some pretty cool sounds. Just listen to this crazy shit Mari made:

Bit by bit we were able to make more crazy sounds, and then we learned how to make crazy melodies. Here is another “song”:

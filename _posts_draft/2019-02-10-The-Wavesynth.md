# The Wavesynth

During the first workshop week in the course Audio Programming, I have been working on a project which I have called "The Wavesynth". I have called it this because I have chosen to use wavetables to shape the output of an oscillator. I have not made a wavetable synthesizer like for instance Ableton's Wavetable (https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/wavetable/), where you can interpolate between waves. instead I use some wavetables created by Google Labs (https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-audio-samples/tree/gh-pages/samples/audio/wave-tables) to make it sound like "real" instruments. The synth is played by using the computer keyboard, and the user can chose the output sound, and adjust three different effects to shape the sound.

### A-team, second week modifications

Tico camera angle:
Since the Tico camera was on the side of the room, the picture that was being sent to Oslo didnâ€™t include all of people present in the class, back in Trondheim.
Therefore we managed to find a better angle for the camera to have all the people in the room, in the picture; and that was done via putting the camera on the center speaker in the room and rearranging the speakers in the room.

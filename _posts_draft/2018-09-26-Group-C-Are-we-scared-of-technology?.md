### The ghost in the machine
We should not be afraid to use machines and electronic devices.
But often we are, even as experts. When a machine turns on, signals are shooting out, often at the speed of light! 
Mostly we can ignore the by-products of this rather harmless scale, but often we found ourselves mainly reacting to a problem or being exposed to a situation we might not want. Sometimes, very suddenly we're confronted with weird noises and lights popping up, random drop outs in the video feed, or we accidentally hit the volume panel on an electronic device. So there is a fundamentally lack of agency when we interact with technologies. When machines are getting more complex and get a broader field of use, the interaction can also become more complex and for us harder to understand. Are there people which are actually able to be in full control of the technology, or do we need to invent new devices to deal with the ones we already have? 


Most of technical equipment suggest a certain kind of usage, like a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) with its default settings of 4/4 time signature, 120 bpm and C-Major scale.
Another example is the midas Mixer (picture), it can imply a musical usage or work flow while we use it instead as tool to route communication channels and make it work for our purpose.
Communication technologies influence and suggest a way of interacting with each other often compromising quality, immersion or security.
In contrast we're tailoring, trying out solutions along the way to develop new ways of communicating in the portal and hopefully carry some useful insights

In our program we have a lot of people with different backgrounds and it is asked from an techno-phil-humanist to make this environment more predictable, reliable since we are surrounded by it constantly.
At the moment basically we have to accept the status quo, to work with the tools available, to trust even we don't trust, to use the de 
..the less insight the less power, very simple but very true in this context. 
From that perspective, it seems as if it is not only advised, but very much necessary to look from time to time a little bit behind the machine curtain.

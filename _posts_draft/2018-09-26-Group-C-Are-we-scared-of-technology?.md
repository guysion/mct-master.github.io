### The ghost in the machine
We should not be afraid to use machines and electronic devices.
But frequently we are, even as experts. Once we push the button, a machine turns on, signals are shooting out - often at the speed of light,
it can happen that we are very suddenly confronted with weird noises and lights popping up, random drop outs in the video feed. Or we accidentally hit the volume panel on an electronic device. We can either ignore these as by-products of a rather harmless scale, but often we found ourselves mainly reacting to a problem or being exposed to a situation we do not know and even don't want. When machines are getting more complex and get a broader field of use, the interaction becomes more complex and for us harder to understand, our sense of agency can appear then very limited. The less insight, less power, very simple but very true in this context. 
From that perspective, it seems as if it is not only advised, but very much necessary to look behind the machine curtain from time to time.

### Plug and pray
Do we need to invent new devices to deal with the ones we already have? 
Most of technical equipment suggest a certain kind of usage, like a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) with its default settings of 4/4 time signature, 120 bpm and C-Major scale.
Another example is the midas Mixer (picture), it can imply a musical usage or work flow while we use it instead as tool to route communication channels and make it work for our purpose.
Communication technologies influence and suggest a way of interacting with each other often compromising quality, immersion or security.

In contrast we're tailoring, trying out solutions to develop new ways of communicating in the portal and hopefully carry out some useful insights. And this is the way we are continuing to work in the portal. 
In our program we have people with different backgrounds and it is asked from a 'techno-phil-humanist' to make this environment more predictable and reliable since we are surrounded by it constantly.
At the moment we basically have to accept the status quo, to work with the tools available, to trust them and believe in the process even we might not know what the outcome will be.

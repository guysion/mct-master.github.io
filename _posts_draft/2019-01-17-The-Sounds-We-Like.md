For our first lesson in the Sonification and Sound Design course, we were asked to give a short presentation of a sonification or a sound design of choice. It was interesting to see the variety of examples among our classmates. Each of us brought a unique example and explained what is it about? why they did choose? and how does it relate to our work at the MCT program?
This is an overview of the examples presented:

## Karolina Jawad - Particles in the air
An installation which discovers the subtle presence of the dust in a room through a sensor and turns it into a generative musical composition and an animation of dust particles. Karolina talked about how it would be interesting the connect the idea of particle sonification in an ocean context, and presented us with another example of a sound installation that utilize the sea, [the sea-organ](https://www.boredpanda.com/sea-organ-nikola-basic-zadar-croatia/?utm_source=duckduckgo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organic).

## Guy Sion - Nissan Leaf
In 2011 Nissan was the first to introduce an artificial car sound for its electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are so quiet at low speeds that they can go unnoticed by pedestrians. In 2017 Nissan debuted the 'Canto' (derived from sing in Latin) which changes the sound Nissan cars make while driving by varying in pitch and tone depending on weather the vehicle is accelerating, decelerating or reversing.
